# CPS593_Final
Final project for the 2018 Spring CPS593 course at SUNY NP.

## About Me
I have been programming in one fashion or another for 8 years or so. In high 
school I taught myself how to program in C\# for creating video games. I 
programmed a review game for a Calculus final and determined that it was
something I wanted to pursue in higher education. I then attended Clarkson
University and received a bachelor's degree in Computer Science after filling
my electives with as many computer science courses as possible. I used many 
common languages and technologies such as Visual C++/C\#, Eclipse, Android SDK,
Java, Apache HTTP Server, HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, Perl, Python, Lisp, g++, 
bash, IBM DB2, and MySQL to name the few I'm more familiar with. I still make 
video games in my spare time. 

Specifically, I do have a little experience in Web Server Programming. I took 
Web Server Administration 1 & 2 at Clarkson University which covered web 
development but in less depth since the course was framed in managing the
LAMP environment as well. We covered a lot of general Linux administrative
topics like user/group management, chron jobs, and grep to facilitate the 
configuration of the LAMP environment. We covered HTML4, JavaScript, JQuery,
Ajax, and replaced PHP with Perl for the 'P' of LAMP. 

After taking those courses I applied some of what I learned by being the lead 
programmer of Critter.buzz, a short-lived social discussion web app designed 
with making discussions and critics more feasible at large university level art 
final galleries. I used Perl and JavaScript to dynamically build, populate, and 
update pages of comments from a MySQL database. However the HTML, CSS, and 
other graphics were handled by the Lead Designer, which I plan to gain more 
experience with alongside other frameworks and server-side scripting during this 
course. 

I am by no means an expert and look forward to learning more. I plan on using 
what I learn about web technologies to improve my personal website, websites for 
my games, and hopefully websites of future employers. In any case, the 
experience of updating and moving a project through different frameworks will 
help me as a Software Developer in general as project management is an area of 
improvement for me to address.
